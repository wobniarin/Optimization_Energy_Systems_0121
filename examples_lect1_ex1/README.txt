Before running the code make sure you change the path in of the excel file to the one on your computer. And make sure you have pyomo and gurobi installed, or you can replace gurobi with any other linear solver.    

To learn Pyomo I reccomend applying book 2 in conjunction with book 1 and lots of trial and error: 
1- "Pyomo — Optimization Modeling in Python" by E. Hart
2- "Power System Operations" by Conejo
